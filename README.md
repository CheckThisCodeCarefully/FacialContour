The facial detection API allows us to not only detect faces & facial features
 but also check those faces for particular properties such as if a smile is present or eyes are open etc.

This is a simple app that recognizes a face in a photo and highlights it with a box. Also, it captures facial features
like eyes, nose, lips, ears etc. All written i Swift4.
